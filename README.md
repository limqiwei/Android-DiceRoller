# Dice Roller - Simple App from Android Tutorial

# Description
This is a simple app made and adapted from the official tutorials provided by Android Studio, with
some additional concepts I tried to incorporate, such as

- Activity Refresh handling when screen is rotating
- Handling night and dark mode
- Creating separate layouts for landscape and portrait mode
- Added Android Icon

Note:<br>
Although the tutorial is done in Kotlin, I have created and followed it using Java.
